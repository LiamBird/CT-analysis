Code for analysing particle size distributions from Avizo and ImageJ:
* LabelAnalysis.py designed for Avizo 'Label analysis' outputs (in .csv)
* ParticleSizeDist.py designed for ImageJ XLib/ 'Beat' outputs (in .csv) NB: the default output from XLib is a .tif file (despite containing text), so needs to be saved with appropriate file extension by user first!
